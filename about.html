    <h1>About Honey</h1>
    <br>
    <p>My name is Honey, I am 20 years old and I own an oragami studio. In the oragami studio I teach
        students how to make interesting oragami. I can make money oragami's such as camel's, chameleons and
        other exquisite animals! 
        <br><br>
        I started my oragami studio because I love teaching kids and I love oragami. Many people encouraged me
        to follow my passion and teach people oragami. 
        <br><br>
        This website was made by Manav Khosla, a good friend of mine. He is currently enrolled in whitehatjr.
        and has created this website for me.
